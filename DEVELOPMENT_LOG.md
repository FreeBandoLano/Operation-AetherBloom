## 🚧 Next Priority: Fix Android Development Environment

### CRITICAL: Android SDK/JDK Issues
The following error prevents adding advanced packages:
```
Execution failed for JdkImageTransform: 
C:\Users\delan\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platforms\android-34\core-for-system-modules.jar
```

### Required Steps (In Order):
1. **Update Android Studio to latest stable version**
   - Current issues with JDK version mismatches
   - Need consistent toolchain

2. **Sync JDK versions between Android Studio and command line**
   - Ensure Flutter uses same JDK as Android Studio
   - Check `flutter doctor` for JDK conflicts

3. **Update Android SDK build tools**
   - Update to latest stable build tools
   - Ensure compatibility with current Flutter version

4. **Clean Gradle caches**
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   flutter clean
   ```

5. **Test with a simple package first**
   - Try adding `shared_preferences` back
   - Verify build works before adding more packages
